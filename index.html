    <h2>Hope for Tommorow</h2>
<p>I believe in a brighter tommorow illuminated by the Sacrifices we go through today
    Therefore we should strive to stay on course no matter how dificult and scary things become
    For Yesterday's History, Tommorow is Mystery but Today is a Gift.

    <h2>Today's Gift</h2>
    <p>Smile for Today, For it's  gift. Do good not looking for any reward but for embracing humanity,
        Care and be optimistic, being fair to your neighbour and doing good as you'd wish it were done to you
        For we are just travellers on the highway to our Eternal Home
